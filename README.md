File Repository for *REDCap Recap*
============

Welcome to the file repository for the OUHSC's *REDCap Recap*.  In the spring of 2018, our regular meeting time remains 10:30-11:30am on the first Tuesday of each month; this follows the [Statistical Computing Users Group (SCUG)](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing) meeting.

Our goal is to qqq.

The code and material from previous presentations in the user group  (formerly called the SAS/R User Group) can be accessed here:  [2018](./2018-presentations/).

The group is open to anyone interested integrating REDCap into their research and clinical projects. If you would like to present, please contact [Thomas Wilson](thomas-wilson@ouhsc.edu).  We encourage any students or employees to participate or present . Alternatively, tell us if there's a technique that would help your research or assignments, and weâ€™ll try to arrange an expert to teach us about it.

The group's steering committee is Thomas Wilson and Will Beasley.

We meet in the East Boardroom of the Samis Education Center in Children's Hospital.  (If you don't see us in the East Boardroom, walk 50 yds to your right and check if we've been moved to the West Boardroom.)  Driving and parking directions are [here](https://raw.github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/master/Documents/Parking.png).  Once inside the main entrance (which is Level 2), head slightly to the right and take an elevator down to Level 1.  Exit the elevator and turn left; pass through the Samis doors.  The [East Board Room](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/blob/master/Documents/SamisEdCenterMap.pdf) will be the first room you see.  Please join us.  Electrical outlets and OUHSC Wi-Fi are available.
